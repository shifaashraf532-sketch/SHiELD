Project Description
SHEild is a high-impact mobile safety tool designed to provide immediate emergency response and automated legal assistance for women. It bridges the gap between mobile software and emergency services to ensure help is always accessible.
The Problem Statement
Women often face situations where they cannot safely or quickly reach for their phones to call for help. Additionally, many lack immediate access to formal legal procedures or information regarding their fundamental rights during an emergency.
The Solution
We solve this by implementing an integrated software suite featuring Shake-to-SOS technology and a digital AI Legal Guide. The app allows users to trigger silent alerts through physical movement or UI interaction and provides instant FIR drafts to bridge the gap between an incident and legal action.
